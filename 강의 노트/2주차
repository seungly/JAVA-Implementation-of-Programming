#### DL vs. ML
Artificial Intelligence ==> Machine Learning ==> Deep Learning

#### 발표1
- GitHub is web-based hosting service for Version Control using Git
- Git is distributed Version Control System for tracking changes in source code
- When program is updated by hundreds of people, updating can be detectied (Who updates this?)
- Visualizing update history effectively ( by table )
- Providing efficient co-work process including push and pull
- Providing efficient version control including branching and merging
- self study : http://gitimmersion.com

#### 발표2

#### Chapter7 Better living in Object World
(p.198)
- superclass(more abstract) vs. subclasses(more specific)
- Variable: static, instance, local
- instance value doesn't have to be initialized
- Inheritance Strenghts
  - Avoid Duplicate
  - Define a common protocol for a group of classes
    When you define a supertype for a group of classes, any subclass of that supertype can be __SUBSTITUTED__ where the supertype is expected
    ==> __Polymorphism__
- ex) Animal myDog = new Dog(); //_available_

<VCS: Version Control System>
1. Feature of VCS
  - Allows developers to work simultaneously
  - Does not allow overwriting each other's changes
  - Maintains a history of every version
2. Types
  - CVCS: Centralized VCS (BUT When server died, everything will be gone)
  - DVCS: Distributed / Decentralized VCS
3. What is Git
  - Open Source Distributed Version Control System
  - Distributed VCS
4. Git vs Github
  - Git: DVCS 그 자체
  - Github: company
5. Terminology
  - working directory
  => git add
  - staging area (index 단계로 감)
  => git commit
  - local repository
  - remote repository
  - Fork : 그냥 가져오는 것
  - Clone : 연결돼 있음
  - Branch : more 연결돼 있음
