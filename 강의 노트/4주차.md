### 1. Inheritance of private Instance
  - with get/set method
  - Can inheritance!!

### 2. Inheritance of private method
  - @Override << check with this annotation
  - __CANNOT inheritance__

### 3. Access the variable of sub class, not super class
  - Use instanceof
  - <Supertype object> instanceof \<object type>

## Abstraction
---
- before class, insert 'abstract'
- For what? Inheritance & Polymorphism

## Multi-inheritance ==> Interface
---
- If one has more than two super classes
- Define interface, and __Implements__ it
- 'Interface' is already abstracted, so 'abstract' keyword doesn't have to be inserted
- Has methods with no body
- No instance variables
- Can't create an object, no constructor
