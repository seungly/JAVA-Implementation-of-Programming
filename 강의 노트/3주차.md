### 1. Initialize inherited variables
* Overriding?
    * Returns supper class' value
    * So variable overriding NOOOO

### 2. Can inherit the private instances
* private variable
    * getter, setter usage => Child object actually doesn't have that private variable
    * So using super class's private var is available, but it is not inheritance

### 3. Merge two project

## @: Annotation

ex) @Override <== removing
```
    public class ~~ extends ~~{
        public void room(){} // spelling error
    }
```
    
==> Error X ! (informing error to notify developer)

## Overriding vs. Overloading
* Overriding
    * Same Argument and Compatible Return
    * Method can't be less accessible (access type cannot changed)
* Overloading
    * Must be different
    * access level free changing

## Abstraction

* In sub class, each method is written specifically
* 'abstract' keyword means that method can be overridden in sub class
* But not abstract method can be in super class, too.
